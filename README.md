## Installation

## Security
Generate Private key & Public Key for the app to authenticate using the keys generated to sign the token.
```bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
```
then generate public key from private.pem
```bash
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```
Optional Rename the keys with extenstion .key

## Environment variables used patter
```javascript
PORT=// Your app port here for development
SECRET=// app secret used to sign the keys (Required)

RT_EXPIRY=// Refresh token expiry time in seconds, default=2*TOKEN_EXPIRY
DB_USER=// MongoDB Username

To use the environment variables use dotenv.config() to access the values or else it's undefined!
